        <p class="ppara">Warranty may be claimed within the specified period in case a manufacturing fault appears. The following
            conditions are applicable:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Warranty is given on behalf of the Manufacturer/Supplier/Distributor. If the product was sold in good
                working condition then the reseller/vendor is not responsible for any defect which may appear later.
            </li>
            <li>If the "Warranty Card Issued" is mentioned on the invoice then the customer should ensure that he/she
                receives the same along with the invoice, else our customer support Centre will not handle the warranty.
            </li>
            <li>The manufacturer/supplier/distributor reserves the right to reject any warranty claim whereby the
                original invoice is missing.</li>
            <li>It is strongly recommended that customers should check the product before leaving our counter, as
                warranty begins once the receipt has been generated. In case of any problem, the product will be treated
                in a normal warranty claim process.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer/supplier/distributor reserves the right to reject any claim whereby the
                product/component is broken or shows signs of burning, rust due to weather conditions.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer/supplier/distributor reserves the right to reject any warranty claim whereby the
                product/component is submitted in improper condition. The product should be well packed in protective
                material supplied while selling.</li>

            </li>
            <li>The product/component may be replaced or repaired at the discretion of the
                manufacturer/supplier/distributor once the warranty claim is accepted. The duration of return may range
                from 3 to 6 weeks. </li>
            <li>The warranty claim may be accepted on a "conditional" basis if we are not satisfied that the defect is
                due to a manufacturing fault. Acceptance of warranty claim, in this case, will depend solely on the
                discretion of the manufacturer/supplier/distributor. Please note that this may take more time than
                normal.</li>

                warranty. Warranty claims for the same will not be entertained.</li>

                the warranty claim will be handled by the user himself. Instruction of the manufacturer should be
                followed.</li>
            <li>Used hardware carries checking warranty only. Please ensure to check purchased hardware is in good
                condition before leaving the counter.</li>
