                <p class="q">1. Is it possible to place an order online and if so, what are the available payment options?</p>
                <p class="a">Online ordering is available and upon receipt of payment, orders will be processed and shipped as
                    soon as possible. The total time for delivery will depend on payment confirmation, processing time,
                    and transit time. It can take anywhere from 24 hours to 10 days for in-stock items. To avoid any
                    delays, please confirm that the shipping address provided to us is accurate.</p>

                <p class="q">2. Is the option of paying in cash upon delivery available?</p>
                <p class="a">Cash On Delivery is available for Karachi; for other major cities, it is only available for orders
                    under a certain limit.</p>

                <p class="q">3. Are the prices of "On Order" products subject to change?</p>
                <p class="a">We strive to keep the prices on our website accurate and consistent. However, due to fluctuations in
                    foreign exchange rates or government policies, we may need to make adjustments to prices without
                    prior notice. Computer Zone reserves the right to change prices on the website at any time. To avoid
                    any confusion, it is recommended to confirm the prices of “On Order” products by a phone call before
                    making any payments.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p class="q">1. What is the purpose of writing reviews?</p>
                <p class="a">We value your feedback and want to provide other consumers with useful information when making
                    purchasing decisions. As a Czone customer, you can submit reviews for items on czone.com.pk. We
                    encourage you to share your thoughts, both positive and negative, about your experiences.</p>

                <p class="q">2. What's not allowed?</p>
                <p class="a">We are happy to provide a platform for customers to share their thoughts on products. While we
                    appreciate your feedback, we ask that you limit your participation to one review per product and we
                    reserve the right to remove any reviews that contain: - Objectionable material such as offensive
                    language, immorality, or illegal conduct - Promotional content including advertisements, repetitive
                    posts, or reviews written by parties with a financial interest in the product or a competing
                    product. - Inappropriate content such as plagiarism, personal contact information, or commenting on
                    other reviews. Please note that we do not accept reviews that are written for compensation or as
                    part of a paid promotion package.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p class="q">1. What do "On Order Only" items mean?</p>
                <p class="a">If a product is marked "On Order Only," it means that the product is not currently in stock and must
                    be ordered from the supplier. Due to fluctuating dollar rates, it is recommended that customers call
                    the company before placing an order for these products to ensure that they are aware of any
                    potential changes in price.</p>
